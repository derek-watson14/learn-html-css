    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However (and this is a big however)</em>, &lt;em&gt; and
        &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
    
    <!-- <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div> -->

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>

    <div>Button</div>
  </body>

<!-- Remember: 
Everything is a box.
Boxes can be inline or block-level.
Boxes have content, padding, borders, and margins.
They also have seemingly arbitrary rules about how they interact.
Mastering the CSS box model means you can lay out most web pages. -->
