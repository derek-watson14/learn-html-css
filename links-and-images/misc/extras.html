    <h1>Extras</h1>
    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may

    <!-- to navigate through multiple directories use ../../elsewhere.html -->
    <!-- this syntax is best kept to a minimum. Root-Relative links are better 
    when many folders must be navigated -->

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
      <p>"HTML entity" is a special character that can’t be represented as plain text 
        in an HTML document. Begin with &amp; and end with ;. There are many.</p>
      <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
        should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
        yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
