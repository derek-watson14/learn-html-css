    <h1>Images</h1>
      <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for 
        <a href="links.html">links</a> and <a href="misc/extras.html">
        useful extras</a></p>
    <h2>JPGs</h2>
      <p>JPG images are good for photos with large color spectrum, 
        but they disallow transparent pixels</p>
      <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
    <h2>GIFs</h2>
      <p>GIFs are good for animations. More limited color pallete than JPG, 
        and limited in transparency (unlike PNGS)</p>  
      <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75' alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>
    <h2>PNGs</h2>
      <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons. They require more memory to contain detail equivilent to 
        an identical JPG. But they handle opacity well and have no color limitations.</p>
      <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball'/>
    <h2>SVGs</h2>
      <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can. They scale to any dimension with no 
        loss of quality. Good for everything PNGs are good for.</p>

      <!-- text fields must be converted to "outlines" in SVGs, which can really increase file size -->
