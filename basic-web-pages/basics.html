    <h1>Interneting is easy</h1> 
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
    
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
    
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
          an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Block level elements are always on a new line, inline elements effect part of the 
         text anywhere on a single line. In short: inline elements effect only part of the line -->
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
    phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
    of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
    <!-- The pseudo-obsolete <b> and <i> elements are classic examples of seperation of structure and appearance. They used to stand for “bold” and “italic”, 
      but HTML5 attempted to create a clear separation between a document’s structure and its presentation. Thus, <i> was replaced with <em>, 
      since emphasized text can be displayed in all sorts of ways aside from being italicized (e.g., in a different font, a different color, or a bigger size). Same for <b> and <strong>. -->
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <hr/> <!-- represents a thematic break, produces a line across the browser by default, with CSS it can be rendered differently -->
    <!-- Another way to think about the <hr/> element is that it carries less significance than the separation created by a new heading element, but more significance than a new paragraph. -->
    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
    soon.</p>
